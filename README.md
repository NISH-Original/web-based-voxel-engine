# Web-based Voxel Engine

A 3D voxel engine inspired by Minecraft built using JavaScript (Three.js), and some HTML and CSS, featuring basic chunk generation, dynamic block addition/removal, and optimization techniques for efficient rendering. This project is a work-in-progress. Access the web version [here](https://nish-original.github.io/web-based-voxel-engine/)

## Features
- Chunk Generation: Generates and loads a 3D chunk, forming the world.
- Block Manipulation: Supports adding and deleting blocks in the world.
- Rendering Optimization: Implements techniques like backface culling to render large numbers of blocks efficiently.
- Real-Time Updates: The engine supports dynamic updates to the world as blocks are added or removed.

## Planned Features
- Procedural World Generation: Develop algorithms to generate terrain dynamically with the help of Perlin Noise.
- First-Person Player Controller: Implement a character controller to navigate the world in first-person perspective.
- Additional Rendering Optimizations: Further improvements to ensure smooth performance as the world grows.
